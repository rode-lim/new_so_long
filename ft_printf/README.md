# ft_printf - Custom Printf Function for C

## Introduction

`ft_printf` is a custom implementation of the `printf` function in the C standard library. This project aims to replicate the functionality of the `printf` function while also providing extensibility for custom format specifiers. It's designed to be a powerful and flexible tool for formatting and displaying text in C programs.

### Features

- Standard format specifiers (e.g., `%d`, `%s`, `%c`)
- Additional custom format specifiers (e.g., `%b` for binary, `%r` for colored output)
- Support for width and precision
- Customizable output handlers
- Error handling and return value management
- And more...
