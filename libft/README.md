# Libft
This is my own library for projects at 42 school

## Getting started...

### Goal:

The goal of the "libft" project is to help students gain a deeper understanding of fundamental C programming concepts and the standard library functions by implementing their own versions of these functions. This project usually involves functions for tasks like string manipulation, memory allocation, and other common operations found in C programming.

# libft - Your C Standard Library

## Introduction

`libft` is a C library that contains a collection of custom-made functions, replicating some of the standard C library functions as well as additional utility functions. This library is designed to serve as a fundamental building block for C programming projects, providing commonly used functions to simplify and streamline development.

### Features

- String manipulation functions
- Memory allocation and manipulation functions
- Character and string testing functions
- Linked list handling functions
- File manipulation functions
- Mathematical functions
- And more...

#### Good luck making your functions <3
PS: I recommend learning how to use the extension map marker for VSCode it helped me organize myself.
